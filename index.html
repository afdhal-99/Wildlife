      For wildlife and nature lovers, Sri Lanka has an amazing diversity of
      fauna, thanks to its varying climatic conditions and topography. <br />
      Therefore the Sri Lanka wildlife parks and conservation zones spread
      throughout the Island provide the best opportunity for sightings.
      <br />Sri Lanka teems with wildlife. From great herds of trumpeting Asian
      elephants to elusive leopards and strange looking sloth bears. <br />
      The country's national parks are home to all manner of amazing creatures.
      Here's a guide to what you can expect to see during your visir.

          Among the top animals in the nation are the blue whale, sperm whale,
          leopard, elephant, and sloth bear. These species constitute only a
          small portion of the abundance of wild animals in the nation. It is
          also well known for being a birder's paradise, with 70 Important Bird
          Areas scattered over its varied terrain housing a wide variety of
          indigenous, migratory, and resident avifauna. The richness of unique
          plants in Sri Lanka is another well-known feature. Of all its wildlife
          attractions, none have inspired as much wonder as those related to the
          world's largest land mammal, the elephant. The world's highest
          population of wild elephants that reoccurs seasonally is found in Sri
          Lanka. The country's Minneriya is the site of this occurrence, which
          goes by the name The Gathering.

          The island is also thought to be the greatest location on Earth to see
          blue whales, the biggest animals to have ever lived. The finest places
          to see these incredible creatures are around the coasts of Trincomalee
          and Mirissa, although Kalpitiya is regarded as one of the top 10
          places in the world to see the incredible sperm whale, which is the
          largest toothed whale in the world. In the meantime, Mirissa provides
          tourists with the best opportunity to observe both of these
          spectacular marine mammals on the same tour.
